# lego-category-labels
Sort your LEGO bricks into categories then label the container with these handy Brother P-touch compatible labels

The QR codes on each label point back to [Brick Architect's amazing LEGO Parts Guide](https://brickarchitect.com/parts/)

Just to clarify: In the second photo, only the SNOT <qr-code> label is my creation. The rest belong to Tom Alphin.
